I am a Master's student at the School of Computer Science, Central South University, under the supervision of Prof. [Min Li](http://bioinformatics.csu.edu.cn/limin/). I previously interned at the [Affective Intelligence and Ubiquitous Computing Research Center](https://ai.smbu.edu.cn/yjzz/qgznypsjsyjzx/zxjj.htm) in Shenzhen. My primary research focuses on multimodal data-driven depression recognition. My broader research interests span multimodal large language models, reinforcement learning, 3D content generation, embodied intelligence, augmented reality, and neural engineering.

## Technical Skills  

* **Machine Learning/Deep Learning**: PyTorch, OpenCV, Transformers  
* **Full-stack Web**: Vue3, Vant, Gradio, Spring Boot, MyBatis Plus, MySQL  
* **3D Graphics**: Unity, UE, Blender  
* **Others**: Linux, Docker, Qt, Android (Java), ESP32  

## Research Experience  

### 1. (08/2023 - 08/2024) [MoChat: Joints-Grouped Spatio-Temporal Grounding Multimodal Large Language Model for Multi-Turn Motion Comprehension and Description](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11404)
* Responsible for skeleton format selection (SMPL, Human3.6M, COCO) and encoder architecture design.  
* Processed NTU RGBD dataset videos and generated annotations using CogVLM.  
* Improved skeleton encoder and introduced a temporal regression module, enabling spatio-temporal localization and description of actions.  
* Trained on 8 × A800 GPUs, achieving state-of-the-art performance on most test metrics.  

### 2. (09/2021 - 06/2022) [Depression Recognition Based on EEG and Speech Fusion](https://github.com/JiaweiMorris/JiaweiMorris.github.io/blob/master/files/%E5%9F%BA%E4%BA%8EEEG%E8%84%91%E7%94%B5%E4%B8%8E%E8%AF%AD%E9%9F%B3%E8%9E%8D%E5%90%88%E7%9A%84%E6%8A%91%E9%83%81%E7%97%87%E8%AF%86%E5%88%AB%E6%96%B9%E6%B3%95.pdf) 
* Preprocessed the MODMA dataset from Lanzhou University using MATLAB and OpenSMILE.  
* Trained multiple machine learning classifiers including KNN, SVM, MLP, Gaussian Processes, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and Random Forests.
* Applied dynamic classifier selection algorithms to achieve a peak accuracy of 97.6% in depression recognition.

## Engineering Projects  

* **Motion Analysis Platform**: Developed skeleton/point cloud visualization with Plotly and multimodal LLM interface using Gradio.  
* **Multimodal Data Collection Platform**: Developed with Vant, Vue3, Spring Boot, MyBatis Plus, and MySQL for managing multimodal data collection. 
* **Android Health Assistant**: Unity + GLM4V app for generating health suggestions via photo analysis.
